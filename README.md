# Quality Knowledge
Welcome to Quality Knowledge, a TeX project that aims to provide an in-depth understanding of statistical concepts and their application in quality management.

This project covers various subjects related to statistics and quality management, including statistical models, hypothesis testing, statistical measures, analysis of variance, time series analysis, and much more. Additionally, the project also explores the work of Dr. W. Edwards Deming, who is widely considered as one of the pioneers of modern quality management.

My goal is to provide comprehensive and easy-to-understand resources for individuals interested in quality management, statistics, and data analysis. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional, you will find valuable information and resources to enhance your knowledge and skills.

I am constantly updating the project with new content, including regression models, statistical plots, correlation, and association, among others. Additionally, I will cover important concepts such as statistical process control, control charts, design of experiments, and quality costs.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback. I hope that Quality Knowledge will be a valuable resource for you in your journey towards mastering statistics and quality management.
