# Quality Knowledge
This project covers various subjects related to statistics and quality management, including statistical models, hypothesis testing, statistical measures, analysis of variance, time series analysis, and much more. Additionally, the project also explores the work of Dr. W. Edwards Deming, who is widely considered as one of the pioneers of modern quality management.

I am constantly updating the project with new content, including regression models, statistical plots, correlation, and association, among others. Additionally, I will cover important concepts such as statistical process control, control charts, design of experiments, and quality costs.
